This folder contains willie.service and willie.cfg designed to be distributed by 3rd party distrubtions such as Fedora Project or Arch Linux.

willie.cfg is a default configuration file for willie, that assumes the OS is new enough to have /run and /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d

willie.service is a systemd service file that assumes you are using a rather recent Willie and has no multiple instance support (TODO). It also assumes that the system has a special user named willie designated for running the bot and this user has access to /run/willie (should be setup by willie.conf in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d), /var/log/willie and /var/lib/willie

Default installation paths:
 willie.cfg	/etc
 willie.conf	/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d
 willie.service	/usr/lib/systemd/system
